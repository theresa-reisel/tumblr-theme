# tumblr-theme
Hi! If you're reading this, you're probably a bit bored with how your blog looks. You might be wanting Vibes, or, like some people I know, you're running an ARG that requires some cool-looking blogs. I know because my friends did that.
Anyways, let's cut to the chase.

I'm cool with doing whatever the fuck you want with this. Change the colors, use it as a base for your own themes, et cetera. Just make sure to credit me (tumblr blog is friendlycursedspaceotter).

Couldn't have made this without buildthemes.tumblr.com, who made a great guide to actually building themes, and countless YouTubers who made HTML and CSS tutorials. Also, thank you to the machine spirits who keep the code going. I couldn't have done it without you.

Go forth and make the Internet fun!
